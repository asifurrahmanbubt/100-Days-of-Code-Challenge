# 100 Days of Code Challenge ðŸš€

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge repository! This repository will contain all my daily code as I embark on a journey to improve my Java skills and deepen my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). My goal is to consistently code every day for 100 days and document my progress here.

## About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Code Challenge is a commitment to code for at least an hour every day for 100 days. During this challenge, I'll be focusing on learning Java and improving my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms. Each day, I will upload the code I write, along with a brief description of what I learned and implemented.

## Learning Objectives

- Master Java programming language
- Understand and implement various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Build a strong foundation for future projects and career opportunities

## How to Navigate This Repository

Each day has its own folder (e.g., `Day 01`, `Day 02`, etc.) containing all the code written on that day. Inside each folder, you'll find:

- Java source files (`.java`)
- Any additional resources or notes related to that day's learning

Feel free to browse through the folders and explore the code. If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out!
